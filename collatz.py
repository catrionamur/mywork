# This program takes in an absolute integer, checks if it is even, if it is even it divides number by 2 otherwise it multiplys by 3 and adds 1
def collatz(num): #Define a function that passes variable of type integer
    while num != 1: #Do the below steps as long until it doesnt reach 1
        print(num) #print out the num variable value
        if num % 2 == 0: #If the num variable value is even so divide by 2
            num = int(num / 2)
        else:
            num = int(3 * num + 1)  #Otherwise the num variable value is odd so divide by 2
    else:
        print(num) #if the number variable reaches 1 end while
        print('Done!')
